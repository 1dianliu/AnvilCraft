Otherwise, it is overloaded and cannot work. The power grid is wireless in this mod, and the power supply range is provided by transmission poles, which connect generators and electrical appliances to the grid. The power unit is KW, which can be analogous to the actual kilowatt, but there is no necessary connection."

Note that left-clicking on a block, left-clicking and head-mallet hitting a mob will consume the anvil hammer's durability, but other operations will not."
